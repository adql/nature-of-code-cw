Back in the days when Processing was Java I first studied through Daniel Shiffman's [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/), fascinated by particles and physical simulation. Years later, on late summer 2018, I took the [MOOC version](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code-ii/info) of it on Kadenze, this time working with the JavaScript implementation p5.js, for refreshment and to get back into creative coding.

p5.js is used under [GNU LGPLv2.1](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/license.txt).

## The Projects

The five small projects here comprise the coursework across different topics, beginning with simple ideas and increasing in complexity.

1. [Random Walker](https://adql.github.io/nature-of-code-cw/1-random-walker/): just a simple exercise of a creature chasing an imaginary creature. Nothing impressive, but the bug is cute [[src](https://github.com/adql/nature-of-code-cw/tree/master/1-random-walker)]
2. [Physics](https://adql.github.io/nature-of-code-cw/2-physics/): a colorful user-controlled animation of flowers that simulates gravity and wind [[src](https://github.com/adql/nature-of-code-cw/tree/master/2-physics)]
3. [Steering Forces](https://adql.github.io/nature-of-code-cw/3-steering-forces/): a zoo with wondering carnivores and herbivores that lose energy and die if they don't get their food [[src](https://github.com/adql/nature-of-code-cw/tree/master/3-steering-forces)]
4. [Fractal Design](https://adql.github.io/nature-of-code-cw/4-fractal-design/): a generator of a static grid of (partially) fractal squares, with several color palettes [[src](https://github.com/adql/nature-of-code-cw/tree/master/4-fractal-design)]
5. [Genetic Algorithms](https://adql.github.io/nature-of-code-cw/5-genetic-algorithms/): A visually minimalist game of spaceship-shooting where the ships evolve to become better at surviving [[src](https://github.com/adql/nature-of-code-cw/tree/master/5-genetic-algorithms)]

There is some inconsistency with the use of the p5.js library, since in the first two assignments I've used the most recent version, while only afterwards I saw that I needed to use an older version provided by the course in order for it to run in the course website (due to ES6 incompatibility).
