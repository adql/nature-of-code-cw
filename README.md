# The Nature of Code @ Kadenze (Coursework)

Back in the days when Processing was Java I first studied through Daniel Shiffman's [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/), fascinated by particles and physical simulation. Years later, on late summer 2018, I took the [MOOC version](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code-ii/info) of it on Kadenze, this time working with the JavaScript implementation p5.js, for refreshment and to get back into creative coding.

The five small projects here comprise the coursework across different topics. There is some inconsistency with the use of the p5.js library, since in the first two assignments I've used the most recent version, while only afterwards I saw that I needed to use an older version provided by the course in order for it to run in the course website (due to ES6 incompatibility).

p5.js is used under [GNU LGPLv2.1](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/license.txt).
